# AI for Scientific Simulation and Discovery Lab

Our research group carries out long-term work on core and universal problems at the intersection of AI + Science:
- **AI for scientific simulation**: Developing machine learning algorithms (based on Graph Neural Networks and Diffusion Models) for large-scale, multi-scale scientific simulation (applied to fluid dynamics, materials, plasmas) and scientific design (protein design, materials design, mechanical design);
- **AI for scientific discovery**: Developing machine learning algorithms (based on neuro-symbolic AI and foundation models) to discover universal rules and internal structures in scientific systems (applied to life sciences and physics);
